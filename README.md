### üõ∞Ô∏è Meshtastic Client for Windows

**A modern Python-based desktop client for managing Meshtastic networks on Windows.**
This project provides an intuitive graphical interface to connect via IP, USB or Bluetooth to Meshtastic devices, monitor nodes in real time, send and receive messages, and manage network settings ‚Äî all without using the command line.

Built entirely in **Python**, it features:

* Real-time node list with distance, hops, and last-heard info
* Message send/receive for the channels public and direct
* Support for light and dark themes
* Direct IP, USB and Bluetooth connection support
* Auto-refresh and status bar with node count
* Automatic ‚ÄúPing ‚Üí Pong‚Äù reply function ‚Äî the client automatically responds to incoming ‚Äúping‚Äù with ‚Äúpong‚Äù on a direct message
* Displays telemetry and position status messages directly in the message feed
* Node count, node filter, and sorting by short name, long name, since, hops, distance, hardware, and role.
* Right click menu on the nodes SendTo, Ping, Show node details.

Standalone Windows GUI for their Meshtastic devices.

     * [CP210x Windows Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
     * [CH9102 Windows Drivers](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH9102_Windows_Driver.html)

4. **(Optional) Clone the official Meshtastic Python repository**

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/meshtastic/python.git
   ```

   üëâ [https://github.com/meshtastic/python](https://github.com/meshtastic/python)

5. **Download this GUI client**
   Place `meshtastic_client.py` (your version) in a folder such as
   `C:\Users\<YourName>\MeshtasticClient`

6. **Run the program**

   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\<YourName>\MeshtasticClient
   python meshtastic_client.py
   ```

7. **Connect your Meshtastic device**

   * **Connection ‚Üí Connect (TCP)** ‚Äî for Wi-Fi / Ethernet connections
   * **Connection ‚Üí Connect via USB/Serial‚Ä¶** ‚Äî for direct cable connection
   * **Connection ‚Üí Connect via Bluetooth‚Ä¶** ‚Äî scan and pair over BLE

8. **Enable Bluetooth in Windows Settings ‚Üí Bluetooth & devices ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdd device‚Äù to ensure permissions.


The exe file is also available ready to use (you not need to install Python first).

Have fun

PS. Use IP or serial - bluetooth is slow.
