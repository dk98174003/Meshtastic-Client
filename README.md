### 🛰️ Meshtastic Client for Windows

**A modern Python-based desktop client for managing Meshtastic networks on Windows.**
This project provides an intuitive graphical interface to connect via IP, USB or Bluetooth to Meshtastic devices, monitor nodes in real time, send and receive messages, and manage network settings — all without using the command line.

Built entirely in **Python**, it features:

* Real-time node list with distance, hops, and last-heard info
* Message send/receive for the channels public and direct
* Support for light and dark themes
* Direct IP, USB and Bluetooth connection support
* Auto-refresh and title with node count default sort since
* Automatic “Ping → Pong” reply function — the client automatically responds to incoming “ping” with “pong” on a direct message
* Displays telemetry and position status messages directly in the message feed
* Node count, node filter, and sorting by short name, long name, since, hops, distance, hardware, and role.
* Right click menu on the node to Show node info.
* Send "To selected" to send direct messages.

Standalone Windows GUI for their Meshtastic devices.

   * **Connection → Connect via USB/Serial…** — for direct cable connection
   * **Connection → Connect via Bluetooth…** — scan and pair over BLE

8. **Enable Bluetooth in Windows Settings → Bluetooth & devices → “Add device” to ensure permissions.


Have fun

PS. Use IP or serial - bluetooth is slow.
