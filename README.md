### 🛰️ Meshtastic Client for Windows and Linux

**A modern Python-based desktop client for managing Meshtastic networks on Windows and Linux.**
This project provides an intuitive graphical interface to connect via IP, USB or Bluetooth to Meshtastic devices, monitor nodes in real time, send and receive messages, and manage network settings — all without using the command line.

Built entirely in **Python**, it features:

* Real-time node list with shortname, longname, since, hops, dist, speed, alt, hw, role
* Message send/receive for the channels public, direct and private (all channels)
* Support for light and dark themes
* Direct IP, USB and Bluetooth connection support
* Auto-refresh and title with node count default sort since
* Automatic “Ping → Pong” reply function — the client automatically responds to incoming “ping” with “pong” on a direct message
* Node count, node filter, and sorting by short name, long name, since, hops, distance, hardware, and role.
* Right click menu on the node to Show node info, Show node on Map and Traceroute the node and delete node.
* Send "To selected" to send direct messages.
* Links menu to Meshtastic internet sites.

Standalone Windows GUI for their Meshtastic devices.

4. **(Optional) Clone the official Meshtastic Python repository**

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/meshtastic/python.git
   ```

   👉 [https://github.com/meshtastic/python](https://github.com/meshtastic/python)

5. **Download this GUI client**
   Place `meshtastic_client.py` (your version) in a folder such as
   `C:\Users\<YourName>\MeshtasticClient`

6. **Run the program**

   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\<YourName>\MeshtasticClient
   python meshtastic_client.py
   ```

7. **Connect your Meshtastic device**

   * **Connection → Connect (TCP)** — for Wi-Fi / Ethernet connections
   * **Connection → Connect via USB/Serial…** — for direct cable connection
   * **Connection → Connect via Bluetooth…** — scan and pair over BLE

git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/meshtastic_client.git
cd meshtastic_client
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "meshtastic[cli]" pyserial bleak pypubsub dotmap timeago requests pyyaml tabulate packaging
```

Add user to serial groups:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
sudo usermod -aG tty $USER
# log out and back in
```

### ▶️ Run

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 meshtastic_client.py
```

### 🧩 Notes

* Works on Raspberry Pi 4/5 with Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm/Trixie.
* No internet connection required after setup.
* To exit the virtual environment: `deactivate`.


Have fun

PS. Use IP or serial - bluetooth is slow.
